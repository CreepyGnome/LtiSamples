Consumer
========

This is a sample LTI Consumer built on top of ASP.NET MVC application template in Visual Studio. It will not run until you add a database.

# Create a folder within Consumer called App_Data if it does not exist
# Add a New Item to the App_Data folder
## Select SQL Server Database
## Name the database file "lti-consumer.mdf"
# Open the Package Manager Console
# Run the command "update-database"
